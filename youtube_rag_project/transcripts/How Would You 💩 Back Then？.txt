You might be reading the title going, uh, does Bucky Boy not know how butts work? Yes, yes I do, concerned viewer. They've worked the same for millions of years, but that's not what I'm talking about here. We didn't always have toilets thousands of years ago. Where did our waste go way back when? What did we do before poo went to the Lou? Q, the intro. Uh, this is ridiculous. Hey there! Welcome to the Life Noggin. It's hard to think of a toilet as a luxury item, but compared to how things used to be, it really is a porcelain throne. The first toilets were just designated bathroom places, like holes dug into fields or along rivers that would wash away their waste. But as towns turned into cities and rivers and fields became less accessible, private, and public bathrooms were created. While these were still essentially a hole in the ground, they had walls, and some places even had seats. As populations grew, the waste really began piling up, and they needed a way to remove it. This is when the first plumbing systems were introduced, about 4,000 years ago. Ancient civilizations like the Minoan, Harapan, and Mesopotamian connected toilets to a series of underground pipes and channels that can be flushed out with water. But, and a big one here, in addition to being dirty and smelling horribly, these pipes could attract vermin for centuries. The most popular way to poop was into a private latrine or into a chamber pot that was emptied into gardens or gutter systems. This practice famously led to the spread of cholera and Victorian London. It wasn't until 1775, when the modern day flushing toilet was invented that had a way to keep the horrendous smell, disease, and vermin out of people's homes. But these really are a luxury. I mean, even today, don't get pissy when I say your potty is a privilege. Today, about 60% of the world's population doesn't have a home toilet that safely manages their waste, and 5% practice open defecation. Meaning, millions of people's health is currently at risk because they lack what most of us take for granted. And that shouldn't be number two on your mind. I don't even know what to ask for the comment question today that isn't wildly inappropriate, so I think it'd be hilarious to list your least favorite movie in the comments. And tell me why you think it's shhh. Uh, bad. What if this video about toilets was just a forum for people to talk about bad movies? And go. Want to watch even more Life Noggin?
