Hey there, welcome to another episode of Dear Blocko, the show where I answer your questions about your world and my world. Today's episode is Santa themed. How timely. Alex D asks Dear Blocko to Santa break any laws with all the things he does every Christmas. Whew, where to start? First off, entering and building through force or through a non-entry point without authorization is breaking and entering. The official charge would be criminal trespassing and since we're talking about people's homes, it would be considered a felony, resulting in hefty fines and jail time. Then there's his method of transportation. Assuming Santa went through the proper channels and got himself the necessary certifications and licenses to fly in each country, he still has to follow the airspace rules. I'm not so sure he's following those. Depending on where he's flying, there are certain requirements he'll need to meet, such as clearance from air traffic control, having a two-way radio and GPS on board, staying within the speed limit and having a certain amount of visibility. Rudolph should come in handy there, I guess. Although I'm sure that using reindeer to pull his sleigh all night long would upset some animal rights groups. But I'm sure they just let these things slide because Santa has the presence they want. Next question up, Loganite asks, Dear Blocko, what Santa's origin story? Well it all began with a 4th century Greek saint who had a reputation for secretly giving gifts. Saint Nicholas was celebrated every December, particularly by the Dutch who called him Cinterclass. When they came to America in the early 1800s, they brought their traditions with them. Over time, Santa's image evolved by the artists and poets who depicted him, transforming him from a stern saint into a jolly old elf who flies to the sky with reindeer delivering presents to deserving children. Finally, in the 1930s, the Coca-Cola Company commissioned an image of Santa Claus for their ad campaign. The artist based it on the popular 1822 poem, A Visit from Saint Nicholas, also known as The Night Before Christmas. And then, the modern version of Santa was created. And now it's time for a question about My World. Helio P. asks, Dear Blocko, can you randomly generate a new life-noggin character I want to see what the animator comes up with? Yeah, I guess he can just do that. Animator randomly generate me a new life-noggin character using all the characters we've made before. Let's meet our new friend. Mommy! Oh, what the f--F-Fricle? Frackel is that! Animator, get rid of it! This was a mistake. I love to learn. Animator, what? So you can delete my neighbor's house because his favorite Pokemon is Mr.Mine, but now all of a sudden you have morals? Meow. Wolf. Okay, fine. I guess they can stay. TriangleBob seems to really like them. What should we name the thing? Let me know in the comments.
