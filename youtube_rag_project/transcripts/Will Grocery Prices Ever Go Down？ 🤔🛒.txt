$10 for eggs. I can't afford this. How am I supposed to make my Facebook AI recipe now? Groceries are draining your paycheck, and there's not a lot of explanation going around. So what's really driving these prices? Hey there, welcome to Life Noggin. While it's normal for prices to go up a little each year, it seems like things have gotten really out of hand. So are these companies ripping you off? Well, in many ways, yes, but also, setting grocery prices is not a simple task. Because at the end of the day, grocery stores are a business and businesses need to make a profit to stay in business. But not every product needs to make a profit. Confusing, I know. I'll explain. There's a lot of variability in milk pricing, for example. Store brands are typically priced at just a few dollars per gallon to compete with the pricing at other retailers. The margins here are small, or even negative with the retailer losing money. While other fancy milks are priced much higher, with some organic milks costing nearly $10 a gallon, with a much higher profit margin since people will pay more for a premium item. When considering all the milks sold at the store, this averages out to the desired profit margins. When you do the same thing, for all the different food categories, you eventually get to your gross margins. That's the overall profit made after accounting for all the costs of buying all the products. So, who sets those costs? Well, there are the produce growers and the food brands who make and package the food, and the wholesalers who act as the middleman between the food makers and the grocery stores. In every aspect, each company is pricing its product based on the same things. The cost of making or acquiring the product, their desired profit margins, and what they think the public is willing to spend. There are shady business practices in all that, but all of these things are what have increased grocery prices. Operating costs both for facilities and farms have gone up. Companies are increasing their profit margins, reaching record highs and supply chain disruptions, like bad weather or animal illnesses, have led to shortages of certain products, which has increased the demand for them. For instance, the bird flu is why eggs cost 37% more than they did last year, and bad weather in West Africa is why chocolate prices are up 150%. But these spikes aren't the norm. They're limited to certain food items, or when we're experiencing a worldwide pandemic. Overall, the inflation we've seen in grocery stores in the last year, 2.5%, is similar to the inflation of the overall economy, 2.9%, and experts predict that 2025 will be much of the same. So while groceries certainly do cost more than they used to, everything else does too. Wait, that doesn't make me feel better. Are we gonna be okay? Uh, does anyone out there know if we're gonna be okay? Anybody? Hello? Anybody? Sorry, I got a little carried away there. Does anyone have a favorite grocery store they're overly passionate about? Let me know in the comments. Mine is Trader Bob's. I love that Triangle Bob makes everything behind a curtain, so I can't see what's happening. That adds fun mystery.
