TriangleBob is having a little trouble with the job market right now, and by that I mean he's been fired from 38 jobs for being one giant pointy work hazard. All things considered he's been pretty lucky. Some jobs come with a much higher fatality rate than others. TriangleBob don't sign up for those jobs, all these career fair tens have a bunch of skulls on them. In the US the average fatal work injury rate per 100,000 full time workers was 3.7 in 2022, which surmounted to over 5,000 deaths. But this rate can vary greatly depending on the type of job. Let's see how some of the world's most dangerous jobs stack up. Hey there, welcome to the life noggin. At number five we have installation, maintenance and repair. Jobs that fall into this category of installation, maintenance and repair had a fatality rate of 8.8 per 100,000 workers in 2022. These occupations include anyone that works with machines or equipment like electricians, mechanics, and technicians. About one third of these deaths were suffered by those working with vehicles and mobile equipment. Grounds, maintenance workers had a particularly high fatality rate of 18.9 with deaths primarily caused by car crashes. Is that a shooting star or did TriangleBob just get blasted off like Team Rocket again? Hmm, anyway, number four is Protective Service. Protective service jobs which include firefighters, law enforcement security guards, and animal control had a fatality rate of 10.2. These deaths are primarily caused by homicides and suicides at 41% and by transportation incidents. No TriangleBob, you don't actually fight the fire, but also the fire is winning my guy tap out. Number three is Construction and Extraction. Those working construction and extraction jobs had a fatality rate of 13 in 2022, with 77% of these deaths suffered by construction workers. The construction industry encompasses a lot of different occupations. Some of the most dangerous jobs in this category include structural iron and steel workers, those who construct and install the framework of building in bridges, contractors or helpers, and roofers. For all these professions, fatalities are most commonly caused by falls, and their individual fatality rates in 2022 were 21.3 for structural workers, 38.5 for helpers, and 57.5 for roofers. TriangleBob, why are you wheezing? Huh, it looks like the building isn't going as you planned. You injured the foreman's hand, and the dozer will not clear a path on account of you exploding it to bits. Tough break. Onto the next job. Number two, Transportation and Material Moving. Transportation and Material Moving Jobs had a fatality rate of 14.6, with 74% suffered by motor vehicle operators, who experienced the most deaths of any occupation. Of these, truck drivers and aircraft pilots are particularly at risk of crashes due to working long hours in unpredictable weather, which made their fatality rates 30.4 for truck drivers and 35.9 for pilots. But material moving jobs can also be dangerous due to the heavy equipment involved. This led to a fatality rate of 20.1 for underground mining machine workers and 22.6 for recyclable material collectors. You know, T-Bob, you actually seem really happy as a sanitation worker. Wait, are you just feeding the garbage to gree? I guess that's one way to do it. And at number one, we have farming, fishing, and forestry. These are the jobs with the highest fatality rate of 23.5. Of those three, agricultural workers suffered the most deaths and had a fatality rate of 20. Fishing and hunting workers had an even higher fatality rate of 50.9, but the highest fatality rate of any profession by far is that of logging workers. They use heavy machinery in rough terrain and face dangers like falling trees, equipment accidents, and extreme weather. Altogether, their fatality rate is 100.7. But farmer Bob, that outfit does look great on you. Oh, look out for the... Oh, now you're hay. I think I'll just pay you to keep being my sidekick, okay? So what is your job if you have one? Or your dream job, maybe. Yeah, yeah, let's go with that. Let me know those dream jobs right now in the comments, manifestation people. Want to watch even more Life Noggin?
