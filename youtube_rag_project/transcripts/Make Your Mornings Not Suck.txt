Have you ever had a rough morning? Maybe you woke up exhausted, looked at your phone, saw the worst news you've ever seen since yesterday's news, got depressed, realized you were running late so you skipped breakfast, but then that just left you feeling stressed and hungry and you're vibrating with anger in your car in bumper to bumper traffic? Let's try to fix that in this video, shall we? Hey there, welcome to Life Noggin. Everyone has terrible mornings from time to time. The good news is that there are steps that you could take to avoid it and actually have a good morning, the phone one later in the video especially, but the first step is getting enough sleep. I know, I know. Get lots of sleep, equal wake better, blocko is genius man, but I need to stress the importance here. In addition to being good for your health, a good night's rest is good for your mood and can also reduce your stress level. Adults 18 and over need at least 7 hours of sleep each night, while teens need 8 to 10 hours. People also make sure the next step is much easier, which is don't hit the snooze button. Set your alarm so you have enough time to do your morning routine and when it goes off, get up. Hitting snooze once can easily snowball and before you know it, you have less than 5 minutes to get to your morning meeting. Stop lying to yourself, you hit snooze, you lose, your job. If you need some motivation, try putting your alarm clock across the room so you physically have to get up to turn it off or if you prefer a gentler method, use a wake up light or an alarm that gradually increases in volume to low you away. Low-fi hip-hop beats to wake up to anyone. Once you're up and at them, the next step is to avoid looking at your phone. This one is crucial, but extremely difficult. I know it's tempting and that 75% of us sleep next to our phones, but checking email or social media first thing in the morning typically just leads to stress and sadness. If you need help with this one, you can leave your phone in another room. Just don't wake up to the news, you don't need to drain your brain of dopamine before the first toilet speed run any percent you attempt in your bathroom. And then you could jump to the next step, which is eating a healthy breakfast. After going 7-10 hours without any food or water, your body does need some energy. Plus eating breakfast makes you feel more alert and productive at school or work and gives you the boost needed for the next step, which is to get moving. I'm not saying do a whole gym routine before the sun's up by the way. Just a light 5-10 minute workout, stretching or even a short walk will get your blood and oxygen flowing, helping you feel more awake and ready for the day. In addition, regular exercise can reduce stress and symptoms of mental health issues, as well as improve your memory and your sleep. Finally, practice some self-care. This can include a relaxing shower, meditation, quietly enjoying your coffee, journaling, whatever makes you happy, make sure you carve some time to slow down and relax before you start your day. So really commit to trying these and see what happens. And be honest, what's your morning routine like now? How could it be better? Maybe share some wisdom in the comments. Or let me know what I should make a video on next. As always, my name is Blocko. This has been Life Noggin. Don't forget to keep on thinking.
