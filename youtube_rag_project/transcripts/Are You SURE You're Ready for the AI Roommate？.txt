These days, robots are everywhere. From the skies to the seas and lots of places in between. That sounded like Dr. Seuss. You could find autonomous machines that sense the environment, make decisions, and perform specific actions to assist you humans. One place they're gaining popularity is in homes. But are AI butlers slash roommates the future or your worst nightmare? Okay, yikes. Well, that one is. Animator, you know you can come up with a new robot design, right? Hey there. Welcome to Life Noggin. These machines are a combination of physical robotic parts and the software that controls them. And both types of technology have been progressing rapidly. Processors and sensors are getting better and cheaper. And recent advances in AI should improve their already impressive capabilities. AI robots have already transformed your world and how you do things. Engineers have developed smart machines that save you time and energy by doing mundane tasks. The most well-known bots for homes are cleaning robots that vacuum floors, wash windows, and scrub pools. Gardening robots that weed and mow, smart thermostats that learn your temperature preferences and schedules, and smart security systems that detect motion outside the home or smoke inside and send alerts. Engineers are also developing a fully automated kitchen. And some restaurants have already begun using robot chefs to flip burgers, fried chicken, or make salads. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Let us. Scientists are developing AI robots that can do much, much more. And as costs go down, we may soon start to see them in the average household. Enjoy your new roommate trying gobbob. He's not in my house anymore. These types of robots can interact with humans. And they include service robots that can act as bartenders, receptionists, and guides, as well as social robots that can provide entertainment, companionship, and other stuff. No, trying gobbob. It's not that kind of robot. Get away. For many companies, the goal with social robots is actually to make them feel like part of the family. They're designed as a loving pet, a helpful caretaker, or a child's friend, playmate, and protector. Why are his eyes glowing like that? Guys, they can recognize your face, detect emotions, talk to you, dance, and and this one is just staring at me so can we please get a less creepy robot please? This one is set to horror movie. Tesla promises a humanoid robot capable of doing basically anything you want. Supposedly, one day we'll be able to babysit the kids, walk the dog, get the groceries, and be your friend. If you combine all that with AI's problem solving and decision-making abilities, you'll never need to lift a finger. But integrating this type of technology into your home could have consequences apart from being an extra in the Wally movie. Like smartphones and apps, these devices may collect personal data and cause privacy concerns. In addition, AI software is particularly vulnerable to hackers. They could steal your information, or take over the device. If somebody hacks TriangleBob's new friend, they can make the robot run away and join the circus. There is also a concern about the growing dependence on machines and how they could replace human interactions. Not to mention the question of whether or not intelligent machines should be granted certain rights. That's a whole different story for another video. With technology advancing as fast as it's been, we better be ready for it. I mean, we probably won't, just looking at history. But we better, because this guy might be your roommate in your lifetime. So how do you feel about AI robot technology? Do you think it can help people, like people with disabilities perhaps? Or should we be more wary of this tech and its heavy downsides?
