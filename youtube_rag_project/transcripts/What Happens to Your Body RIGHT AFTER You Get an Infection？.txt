In this moment, something just slipped into your body. And no, not like that. Stop giggling. You don't know it. You can't feel it, but the infection has already begun. So what happens next when you- Sorry, I can't keep doing this voice. This video is about what happens to your body after you get an infection. Hey there! Welcome to Life Nuggin. As the name suggests, microbes are microscopic. Invisible to the naked eye. They include bacteria, viruses, and fungi, all of which can cause serious life-threatening diseases. Yay! But how can something so small cause so much harm? It's honestly astounding. You humans are still here. It all starts with when they enter your body. Either through your mouth, eyes, nose, or open skin. This is when the first stage of the infection begins, known as the incubation stage. Almost immediately, the harmful microbes, also known as pathogens, start reproducing. Bacteria do this in 20 to 30 minutes, while viruses are even faster. Luckily, the white blood cells traveling through your bloodstream and tissues will soon locate the invaders and sound the alarm. This is when your immune system kicks into gear, which is the start of the progromal stage. Your first defense mechanisms activate, such as an increase in body temperature to inactivate the pathogen and the production of antibodies by the white blood cells, which attach to the harmful microbes and kill them. These mechanisms can result in mild symptoms, such as a fever or headache. But if the first immune reaction doesn't suppress the pathogen, the next stage begins, which is the illness. Now the pathogen is disrupting the function of your human cells. It may crowd them out, release a toxin that paralyzes them, or simply kill them. In response, your immune system will increase its attack, which includes the release of a chemical called interferon that prevents the pathogen from reproducing. And yes, that is its real name I looked it up. All of this causes you to feel tired and achy, and other symptoms begin to develop depending on the type of infection, like a cough, runny nose, or nausea. This is when the type of illness becomes important. You may recover on your own once your immune system wins its battle, or if you're lucky enough to have access to healthcare, a doctor may prescribe you medication, such as an antibiotic or antiviral, to kill the pathogen or stop it from spreading. But there are some pathogens that can cause a repurable harm to your body, which can cause lasting effects even after you make it through the decline and covalescent stages of the infection, when you successfully fight off the infection and your illness symptoms subside. And there are some diseases that are deadly, either due to having a compromised immune system, or just the type of pathogen. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 17 million people die from infectious diseases every year. So how can you keep yourself and those around you healthy and safe? Well, the best things you can do are wash your hands often. Practice food safety techniques, practice safe, uh, wrestling and bed, stay home when you're sick, and stay up to date on vaccinations. Seriously, wash your hands after going potty people, some of you are cause playing as Edward do do hands the way you bypass the bathroom sinks. So what would you like me to make a video on next?
