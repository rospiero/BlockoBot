Hey there, welcome to Life Noggin. This brain island is cool and all, but it's not real, per se. Your brain is very real, and it's a little... how should I put this... broken? I can prove it to you. Let's try an experiment right now while you're watching this. I'll need a few basketballs, please. Here is your mission if you choose to accept it. Count how many times the basketballs were passed around by the people in white shirts. Watch closely as the basketballs might end up being passed elsewhere. Ready? Okay, trying to bob pull the curtain. So, did you happen to catch the gorilla walking in the background? You can go back and check it was there. Also some ninja turtles popped in, and the arms of the people in the black shirts were inflating slightly. Okay, next up we're going to see how fast you can count this time. So count the footballs as they fly across the screen and see if you can spot the one soccer ball. It'll happen quickly, so get ready to count. Well, did you catch the we added a second soccer ball? You did? Well, great. Did you see the message on the scoreboard though? If you watch these videos again, you'll most likely see all the details without any problem. So why did you miss them the first time around? To answer that, we need to get back to the brain. This is where your visual information is processed and translated into objects. This happens in 200 to 300 millisecond periods of time called fixations. But of course the world is full of visual information, especially in fast paced areas like a busy street or a sporting event. So for each fixation, your brain focuses on what it thinks is the most important at the time, selects the relevant visual information and builds a picture. The rest of the visual information is barely comprehended, which is why you may not notice it. But don't just take my word for it. Try it out. This image was created by researchers studying attention illusions like the ones we showed you at the beginning of the video. While keeping your eyes on the blue dot in the center, focus your attention on one of the surrounding gray circles. Did you notice that the circle becomes brighter than the other two? In reality, your brain's not illuminating that circle. It's actively suppressing the two circles you're not focusing on. This can lead to your brain outright ignoring objects or people in your line of sight. This phenomenon is known as an attention blindness, where you don't see things that are right in front of you simply because you're paying attention to something else. This may be because you're completing a certain task, like counting passes or footballs, or because something is distracting you, like a bright color, movement, or a familiar face. But this doesn't only happen when there's a lot of visual input. It also occurs when your brain is expecting to see something. Look at this, for example. Don't worry. We won't hide anything in the background this time. So go ahead and read this. What does it say? Did you read it as a bird in the bush? Then your brain completely missed the extra the. If you liked this video, let us know and we'll bring you more brain-related topics, like the philosophical zombie experiments. By the way, let me know in the comments if you found all the hidden grigs in this video. Or tell me, what should I do a video on next? We're taking suggestions for future videos right now.
