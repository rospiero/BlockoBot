Dear Blocko, why is space dark if the sun is so bright? Yeah, if the sun shines at a whopping 3,860 trillion trillion watts, then why is space so dark? Good question. Space is huge. No one knows how huge, but scientists estimate that the observable universe, just the part we can see, is 46 billion light-years in every direction, creating a sphere with a volume of 410 non-nillion cubic light-years. And it's filled with roughly 200-sextillion giant balls of hot gas, also known as stars, burning at temperatures reaching 60,000 Kelvin, some with a brightness over 100,000 times the sun. And yet, all around us is darkness. So what gives? The answer is all around you. I mean, literally, it's the dust, dirt, water vapor, everything in the atmosphere that surrounds the earth. You see, light travels in a straight line until it hits something, like water vapor or dust. This causes it to scatter into the different visible light colors we can see. The reason why we see space as black is because in space, the light doesn't have a lot of cosmic dust bounce off of. But it does have some, so why don't we see at least some visible light in space? The reason scientists think we don't is because the universe is expanding away from Earth, which means the light from other stars is also moving away from Earth. And when light moves away from something, its wavelength gets longer and longer, until there's no visible light to be seen at all. Wanna watch even more Life Noggin?
