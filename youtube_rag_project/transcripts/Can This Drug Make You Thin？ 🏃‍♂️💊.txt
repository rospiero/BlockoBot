Dear Blocko, why is everyone in their mother on OZEMPIC or WIGOVI? Great question. Those aren't Pokemon names, although they sound like it. OZEMPIC and WIGOVI are medicines, and they're raking in billions of dollars, because some people are using them to lose weight. Triangle Bob here wanted to slim down for the holidays. He thinks OZEMPIC will make him a skinny isosceles, very quickly, but that's not exactly what it was designed to do. So, what is OZEMPIC? OZEMPIC was created to treat type 2 diabetes. It's a type of drug called a GLP1 agonist, which mimics the GLP1 hormone in your body. This hormone helps produce more insulin, slows digestion, and lowers blood sugar levels. It also makes you feel full, which causes appetite suppression. This is why, along with nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue, weight loss is a common side effect of OZEMPIC and other GLP1s. In fact, studies have found that these drugs can cause more than a 15% reduction in body weight. This has led to the growing trend of using these medications off-label, not for what they were approved for, but solely to lose weight, as well as new brands like WIGOVI, which has been approved for chronic weight management. But this surge in popularity has caused drug shortages, risking the lives of patients who actually need them to manage their type 2 diabetes. These drugs can also cause severe side effects, and can be dangerous for individuals with certain health conditions, so medical supervision is essential. These drugs are not for everyone, and whether or not you're taking them if you're trying to lose weight, physicians still recommend that you maintain a healthy lifestyle with exercise and a reduced calorie diet.
