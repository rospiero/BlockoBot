Hey there, welcome to DearBlocko. Tryngobb, let's bring out the question bag and answer some viewer questions. First up, we have one from Vampire Dragon 9925. Cool name, DearBlocko, what happens if we accidentally eat spoiled food? Well, you might start vomiting or have diarrhea. Basically, your body is trying to shoot the bad stuff out ASAP. This can happen due to bacteria like salmonella or coli that grow when food isn't stored properly. Always check those expiration dates and give it a sniff before you dig in. Next question, huh? This is also from Vampire Dragon. Well, really lucky pull, I guess. DearBlocko, do you have any enemies? I do, his name is Mako. He looks like me, but more annoying, has a curly mustache. He knows very little and he smells like a fish market. Next up, okay, trying a bob, this is from Vampire Dragon 2. See? DearBlocko, how do you make a smoothie? By the way, you blend fruit, try to add some greens like spinach and kale, but massage the kale first. Are these all from the same Vampire Dragon? Wait, these are all from the last six months and we never answered any of them? Oh man, now I feel bad. Uh, well they're all here, so I guess this is a DearBlocko speed round. It's your lucky day Vampire Dragon 9925, we're probably only doing this once. DearBlocko can video games relieve stress? Research from the American Psychological Association says yes, they can actually reduce your cortisol levels, so tell that to your parents, depending on the game they can improve your mood and relax you. No strengthens friendships as long as it's not Mario Party or Mario Kart. DearBlocko, what's the best way to enjoy a theme park? With friends, light snack to start the day, map out your plan beforehand, have a party game on your phone ready to play with friends while you're in line. Ride the less popular rides first, eat lunch at 11 a.m., ride the popular rides during lunch time when a majority of the people would be eating. DearBlocko, what happens if you eat burnt popcorn? Uh, it tastes bad. If you eat enough of it, you might get a stomach ache? I'd be more worried about the PFAS in the microwave popcorn bags though. DearBlocko, who's your favorite Pokemon and why? That would be sloping, because it's smart. I wonder what my full team of six would look like. DearBlocko, what happens if you drink too much soda? Short term, tummy ache, and lots of pee. Medium term, tooth decay, sleep disruption, long term, risk of type 2 diabetes. All those are not fun. Please drink this stuff in moderation. DearBlocko, what if it rained hamburgers? Uh, well, this would get quite messy. Stinky and unsanitary, fat idea, moving on. DearBlocko, can eating too much candy make you sick? Most definitely, too much candy can upset your stomach because of all that sugar. This can spike your blood sugar and cause headaches and nausea. Eating too much sugar over time is also bad for your teeth and can lead to bigger health problems. DearBlocko is burnt popcorn safe to eat. Didn't you ask this before? My friend, how often do you burn your popcorn? I'd wait until the kernels are popping infrequently from the last pop you heard. For your more seconds between pops, and you need to stop. DearBlocko, what happens if we eat too many fruits and veggies? Well, even though fruits and veggies are super good for you and are better than candy, eating too much can cause bloating, gas, or even diarrhea. We're talking about a fiber overload, people. Some fruits are also high in natural sugars, which can spike your blood sugar if you consume too much. But stick with the veggies and fruits over popcorn candy, please. DearBlocko, what happens if there's food stuck in my teeth? Short term, you get some laughs from a friend or significant other. Short term, that food can mix with bacteria and create plaque that can lead to gummish use, bad breath, and cavities. So please brush and floss those teeth. I feel like I'm a parent in this episode. DearBlocko, what's your favorite thing about the holidays? The presents. I mean food. Wait, I mean family. Family for sure. DearBlocko, what happens if we burn popcorn is it okay to eat? Again? Vampire dragon, I need you to back away from the popcorn before you burn your house down. I hope you weren't waiting for me to answer this before you ate it. Just throw it out and try again. DearBlocko, what would happen if you were bitten by a vampire? Are we talking vampire dragon or just vampire? Both would hurt Spider-Monkey. DearBlocko, can playing just dance help you lose weight faster? I don't know about faster, but if you kept eating healthy and played frequently enough, I think that form of cardio could help you lose weight. Triangle Bob gets pretty sweaty during that game, so it's gotta be doing something. And lastly, dearBlocko, have you ever had a paranormal experience? I have. While recording this video, I thought I saw the ghost of Grandpa Noggin about five times. See if you can find them in the background of this video. Well, there you have it, vampire dragon. Sorry we missed all of those questions. I hope you learned something even if you're not vampire dragon 9925. And I'd love for you to keep those questions coming.
