Dear Blocko, are Pokémon cards a scam? I see someone's been burned. If you're a Pokémon fan, you may be scrambling to get your hands on the new set. And I get it. The artwork on these cards are stunning. But what's not so beautiful are the prices. Those individual evolutions cards are going for hundreds to thousands of dollars. So is that scammy? Pokémon is the most valuable media franchise in the world with all-time sales reaching $100 billion US dollars. That's about equal to the sales of the Harry Potter, Marvel, and Star Wars franchises combined. So it may not be a huge surprise that the release of prismatic evolutions in January set many collectors and scalpers to the shelves quickly buying up all the available packs. Now retailers are sold out and the only way to get these cards is from the trading card market. And with high demand comes high prices. The manufacturer's suggested retail price, MSRP, of the Elite Trading Box is about $60 US dollars. It comes with 9 booster packs, each with 10 playing cards, and a bunch of other stuff. After its release, the market price for that box was 150, nearly 3 times its MSRP. It's dropped to about 100 to 120 with a high of about 200, but that's for the box, which only gives you the chance to pull one of those super rare, gorgeous, EV cards. If you wanted to buy one directly, well that will cost you a lot more. Depending on which evolution you were after, you would need to pay anywhere from 270 for Jolteon EX to 1600 for Umbreon EX. But don't worry, these inflated prices shouldn't last too much longer. Shortly after the January release, the Pokemon Company announced that they are actively working to print more cards to combat the shortages when those cards will hit the shelves is anyone's guess. But are they a scam? Well, if you really love Umbreon that much, then isn't this beautiful thing worth $1,600? No, no it's not. Want to watch even more Life Noggin?
