Dear Blocko, what if you sat at your computer forever? Great question. I think my animator might have a thing or two to say about that one. At first, everything seems fine. You're productive. Knocking out emails and sipping on coffee. But if you stay that way for too long, things can go downhill pretty quickly. In just a week, you might notice dry eyes, next stiffness, and wrist pain creeping in. It's nothing major yet, but your body is already sending warning signs. Fast forward a few years, and the effects start piling up, where posture turns into chronic back pain. Your muscles weaken from lack of movement. Your circulation slows, increasing the risk of serious health issues, like heart disease. Some researchers have even created an image of their own idea of what prolonged technology use might do to humans in just 800 years. They've named this creation Mindy. Let's take a look at Mindy. Oh, oh god. Oh no, that's horrible. With features like hunched necks from looking at screens, claw-like hands from typing too much, thicker skulls, smaller brains, and even a second eyelid to protect against blue light, it's easy to see how prolonged computer use can turn humans into nightmare fuel. Okay, maybe that's all a bit dramatic. But the risks of constant sitting at the computer are very real. The good news is it's easy to avoid this nightmare. No, no, get that off the screen. I don't want to look at that anymore. Being regular breaks to stretch, adjusting your desk and chair to an aerodynamic setup, and spending more time standing or walking can make a huge difference. Remember, practice these whenever you can. Your body and future self will thank you. Want to watch even more Life Noggin?
