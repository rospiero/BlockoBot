Hey there, I'm Pat, I'm the co-creator of Life Noggin. I know I sound like Blocko, but look, see, I'm not. Our team- Oh no you don't, this is my channel, you flesh monster. Our team is super thankful for all the support this community has shown us over the years. I appreciate everyone who has cared enough to comment, liked enough to like, and most importantly, had fun learning something. You've probably guessed what this is based on the title, but I'll say it anyway. We're starting our Patreon back up. The link is in the description if you just want to head there right now. Over the years, the shifting sands of the internet have made it harder to fund our educational content. We've been lucky enough to keep operations going, but we're asking for help to keep on making Life Noggin happen. The entire Life Noggin team, Greek included, is really passionate about trying to continue our journey. And that's why we're launching the Patreon. We have one tier right now to make it easy. $3 gets you your name at the end of every video, exclusive merch discounts, and one team chat a month doing everything from brainstorming video ideas, drawing really terrible sketches of future thumbnails, or chatting about things we care about that month. We'll expand on these perks in the future, but we want it to quickly set up a way for you to support us further if you had the ability to. And get something out of it. Click the first link in the description right now to join. We want you to know that joining the Patreon does help us tremendously, but even you just continuing to watch, like, and comment means the world to us. Thank you for supporting us and for being curious with us. We'll see you on the Patreon or on our next video, but as always, my name is Blocko. This has been Life Noggin. I think I gave Pat a concussion and don't forget to keep on thinking.
