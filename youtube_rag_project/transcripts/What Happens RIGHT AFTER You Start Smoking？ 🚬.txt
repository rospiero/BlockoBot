You already know that smoking is bad for you. I'm sure you're well aware of the dangerous and life threatening side effects caused by years of smoking cigarettes or e-cigarettes. But what about smoking for just a day? Or even just one minute? What is going on inside your body right after you start smoking? Hey there, welcome to Life Noggin. You're probably thinking surely one cigarette can't do that much damage, right? Well, even one puff is terrible for you. Tobacco smoke contains over 70 chemicals that are known to cause cancer. This includes radioactive compounds, metals, and arsenic as well as carbon monoxide, which is a poisonous gas that replaces the oxygen in your blood that your tissues, organs, and cells need, oxidizing chemicals that damage the heart muscles and blood vessels and lead to the build-up of fatty materials, which result in heart disease and stroke and nicotine, which is highly addictive. As you breathe into tobacco smoke, the chemicals kill the good bacteria in your mouth. This causes you to have a dry, itchy mouth, and bad breath. As the smoke enters your nose and throat, the chemicals irritate the lining, which can make you start to cough. In the lungs, the chemicals are absorbed into your bloodstream. As the carbon monoxide reduces your blood oxygen levels, you may notice you can't hear as well. This is because the oxygen in your inner ear becomes depleted. The nicotine will increase your heart rate and blood pressure, making it harder for your blood to circulate. This, coupled with a lower blood oxygen level, will make any physical activity difficult. Some studies have also found that nicotine may reduce your sense of smell and taste, and make you feel hungry. It takes about one to three days for these chemicals to fully leave your bloodstream and for your body to return to normal, as long as you don't take another puff. Like I said, nicotine is highly addictive and newer tobacco products contain even more nicotine than traditional cigarettes. A recent study found that smoking a single cigarette reduces your life expectancy by about 20 minutes, which means that a pack of cigarettes takes almost seven hours off your life. So if you're considering trying it, just don't. And for those of you who already smoke, look, I know quitting isn't easy, but it has a huge number of health benefits, including reversing the damage and risks to your health and adding years to your lifespan. There are lots of resources out there that can help you make a plan and stick with it. And the sooner you quit, the sooner your body will be thanking you. I mean, don't you want to live to see all the future Pokemon games? That should be a good reason to quit smoking. You want to see what weird monsters they're coming out with in 2035, right?
